This Agreement is not\n            assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with\n            Company’s prior written consent.

No agency,\n            partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of\n            this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind\n            to bind Company in any respect whatsoever. In any action or\n            proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing\n            party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All\n            notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed\n            to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when\n            receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or\n            e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by\n            recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by\n            certified or registered mail, return receipt requested.

If Customer\n            requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime\n            calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance.\n            Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party\n            connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Company’s control\n            will also be excluded from any such calculation. Customer’s sole and\n            exclusive remedy, and Company’s entire liability, in connection with\n            Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime\n            lasting longer than two hours, Company will credit Customer 5% of\n            Service fees for each period of 6- or more consecutive minutes of\n            downtime; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per\n            day. Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as Customer (with notice\n            to Company) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues\n            until the availability of the Services is restored. In order to\n            receive downtime credit, Customer must notify Company in writing\n            within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide\n            such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. Such\n            credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative\n            beyond a total of credits for one (1) week of Service Fees in any\n            one (1) calendar month in any event. Company will only apply a\n            credit to the month in which the incident occurred.
