            reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information, and
            (ii) not to use (except in performance of the Services or as
            otherwise permitted herein) or divulge to any third person any such
            Proprietary Information. The Disclosing Party agrees that the
            foregoing shall not apply with respect to any information after five
            (5) years following the disclosure thereof or any information that
            the Receiving Party can document (a) is or becomes generally
            available to the public, or (b) was in its possession or known by it
            prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party, or (c) was rightfully
            disclosed to it without restriction by a third party, or (d) was
            independently developed without use of any Proprietary Information
            of the Disclosing Party or (e) is required to be disclosed by law.
          </p>

            Customer Data[, as well as any data that is based on or derived from
            the Customer Data and provided to Customer as part of the Services].
            Company shall own and retain all right, title and interest in and to
            (a) the Services and Software, all improvements, enhancements or
            modifications thereto, (b) any software, applications, inventions or
            other technology developed in connection with Implementation
            Services or support, and (c) all intellectual property rights
            related to any of the foregoing.
          </p>

          <p>
            [Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, Company shall have the
            right collect and analyze data and other information relating to the
            provision, use and performance of various aspects of the Services
            and related systems and technologies (including, without limitation,
            information concerning Customer Data and data derived therefrom),
            and Company will be free (during and after the term hereof) to (i)
            use such information and data to improve and enhance the Services
            and for other development, diagnostic and corrective purposes in
            connection with the Services and other Company offerings, and (ii)
            disclose such data solely in aggregate or other de-identified form

            Order Form for the Services and Implementation Services in
            accordance with the terms therein (the “Fees”). If Customer’s use of
            the Services exceeds the Service Capacity set forth on the Order
            Form or otherwise requires the payment of additional fees (per the
            terms of this Agreement), Customer shall be billed for such usage
            and Customer agrees to pay the additional fees in the manner
            provided herein. Company reserves the right to change the Fees or
            applicable charges and to institute new charges and Fees at the end
            of the Initial Service Term or then‑current renewal term, upon
            thirty (30) days prior notice to Customer (which may be sent by
            email). If Customer believes that Company has billed Customer
            incorrectly, Customer must contact Company no later than 60 days
            after the closing date on the first billing statement in which the
            error or problem appeared, in order to receive an adjustment or
            credit. Inquiries should be directed to Company’s customer support
            department.
          </p>

          <p>
            Company may choose to bill through an invoice, in which case, full
            payment for invoices issued in any given month must be received by
            Company thirty (30) days after the mailing date of the invoice.
            Unpaid amounts are subject to a finance charge of 2.5% per month on
            any outstanding balance, or the maximum permitted by law, whichever
            is lower, plus all expenses of collection and may result in
            immediate termination of Service. Customer shall be responsible for
            all taxes associated with Services other than U.S. taxes based on
            Company’s net income.
          </p>

          <h3>5. TERM AND TERMINATION</h3>

          <p>
            CSubject to earlier termination as provided below, this Agreement is
            for the Initial Service Term as specified in the Order Form, and
            shall be automatically renewed for additional periods of the same
            duration as the Initial Service Term (collectively, the “Term”),
            unless either party requests termination at least thirty (30) days
            prior to the end of the then-current term.
          </p>

          <p>
            In addition to any other remedies it may have, either party may also
            terminate this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice (or without
            notice in the case of nonpayment), if the other party materially
            breaches any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement. Customer
            will pay in full for the Services up to and including the last day
            on which the Services are provided. All sections of this Agreement
            which by their nature should survive termination will survive
            termination, including, without limitation, accrued rights to
            payment, confidentiality obligations, warranty disclaimers, and
            limitations of liability.

            reasonable efforts to provide advance notice in writing or by e-mail
            of any scheduled service disruption. However, Company does not
            warrant that the Services will be uninterrupted or error free; nor
            does it make any warranty as to the results that may be obtained
            from use of the Services. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THIS
            SECTION, THE SERVICES AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS
            IS” AND COMPANY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
            INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY
            AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

            ALL EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY SUPPLIERS), OFFICERS, AFFILIATES,
            REPRESENTATIVES, CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES SHALL NOT BE RESPONSIBLE
            OR LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT OR
            TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELATED THERETO UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE,
            STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY: (A) FOR ERROR OR INTERRUPTION OF
            USE OR FOR LOSS OR INACCURACY OR CORRUPTION OF DATA OR COST OF
            PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY OR LOSS OF
            BUSINESS; (B) FOR ANY INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR
            CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES; (C) FOR ANY MATTER BEYOND COMPANY’S
            REASONABLE CONTROL; OR (D) FOR ANY AMOUNTS THAT, TOGETHER WITH
            AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEED THE FEES PAID BY
            CUSTOMER TO COMPANY FOR THE SERVICES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IN THE 12
            MONTHS PRIOR TO THE ACT THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY, IN EACH
            CASE, WHETHER OR NOT COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
            SUCH DAMAGES.
          </p>

          <p>
            THE COMPANY IS NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY 3RD PARTY CUSTOMER
            SPEND BASED ON AND NOT LIMITED TO JUDGEMENT. ANY DISPUTES OR
            MISALLOCATED SPEND SHALL NOT BE RECOVERABLE THROUGH ANY INCIDENT.
            YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR
            RELATED TO THESE TERMS, COMPANY PROPERTIES OR THE CONTENT MUST
            COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES.
            OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED. THE COMPANY
            HAS THE RIGHT TO SETTLE ANY CLAIM OR DISPUTE.
          </p>

          <h3>8. MISCELLANEOUS</h3>

          <p>
            If any provision of this Agreement is found to be unenforceable or
            invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum
            extent necessary so that this Agreement will otherwise remain in
            full force and effect and enforceable. This Agreement is not
            assignable, transferable or sublicensable by Customer except with
            Company’s prior written consent. Company may transfer and assign any
            of its rights and obligations under this Agreement without consent.
            This Agreement is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual
            understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous
            written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings
            relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all
            waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both
            parties, except as otherwise provided herein. No agency,
            partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of
            this Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind
            to bind Company in any respect whatsoever. In any action or
            proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing
            party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees. All
            notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed
            to have been duly given when received, if personally delivered; when
            receipt is electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or
            e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery by
            recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by
            certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. This
            Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of [New York]
            without regard to its conflict of laws provisions. [The parties
            shall work together in good faith to issue at least one mutually
            agreed upon press release within 90 days of the Effective Date, and
            Customer otherwise agrees to reasonably cooperate with Company to
            serve as a reference account upon request. THE COMPANY IS NOT
            RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LEGAL FEES IF SUIT IS BROUGHT AGAINST OR LEGAL
            ACTION IS TAKEN SET FORTH FROM THE COMPANY.]
          </p>

          <h3>EXHIBIT A</h3>
          <p>Service Level Terms</p>
          <p>
            The Services shall be available 99.9%, measured monthly, excluding
            holidays and weekends and scheduled maintenance. If Customer
            requests maintenance during these hours, any uptime or downtime
            calculation will exclude periods affected by such maintenance.
            Further, any downtime resulting from outages of third party
            connections or utilities or other reasons beyond Company’s control
            will also be excluded from any such calculation. Customer’s sole and
            exclusive remedy, and Company’s entire liability, in connection with
            Service availability shall be that for each period of downtime
            lasting longer than two hours, Company will credit Customer 5% of
            Service fees for each period of 6- or more consecutive minutes of
            downtime; provided that no more than one such credit will accrue per
            day. Downtime shall begin to accrue as soon as Customer (with notice
            to Company) recognizes that downtime is taking place, and continues
            until the availability of the Services is restored. In order to
            receive downtime credit, Customer must notify Company in writing
            within 24 hours from the time of downtime, and failure to provide
            such notice will forfeit the right to receive downtime credit. Such
            credits may not be redeemed for cash and shall not be cumulative
            beyond a total of credits for one (1) week of Service Fees in any
            one (1) calendar month in any event. Company will only apply a
            credit to the month in which the incident occurred. Company’s
            blocking of data communications or other Service in accordance with
            its policies shall not be deemed to be a failure of Company to
            provide adequate service levels under this Agreement.
